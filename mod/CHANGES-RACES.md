# Racing+ Race Formats

## Unseeded

* Historically, most races have been unseeded. This means that both players start with the same character but play on different seeds.
* Each player is allowed to reset as many times as they want. Typically, each player will reset over and over until they find a good starting item from the Basement 1 Treasure Room.
* There are no additional changes to the game in this format.

## Seeded

* In seeded races, both players play on the same seed. (This means that they should get all of the same items, bosses, and so forth.)
* Resetting is allowed, but it will just take a player back to the beginning of the same seed.
* Each player will start with a [pre-defined starting item](https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-client/blob/master/src/data/builds.json) that is chosen before the match, such as Cricket's Head or Mom's Knife.
* The Basement 1 Treasure Room is barred. (This is to prevent players from starting with 2 items instead of 1.)
* All characters start with The Compass and the Schoolbag in addition to their other items.
* If the character is supposed to start with an item that is not the D6, that item will be inside the Schoolbag.
* The Cain's Eye trinket is removed from the game.
* There is a custom death mechanic:
  * Instead of dying, players will respawn in the previous room with 1.5 soul hearts.
  * They will have a "debuff" effect that removes all of the items. The debuff will last 45 seconds.
  * This mechanic does not apply to deaths in Devil Rooms or Sacrifice Rooms. (Deaths in those rooms will be permanent.)

## Diversity

* Diversity races are similar to unseeded races in that each player plays on different seeds and is allowed to reset as much as they want.
* However, each racer starts with the same five random items. (This is in addition to the character's original passive items and resources.)
* For additional information, see [the documentation for diversity races](https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-client/blob/master/mod/README-DIVERSITY.md).

## Unseeded (Lite)

* All Treasure Rooms on Basement 1 will have two items.
* Tech X, Mom's Knife, Epic Fetus, and Ipecac are automatically rerolled if you see them in a Basement 1 treasure room.
* The "fast-reset" feature is disabled.
* The "fast-clear" feature is disabled.
* Mom's Hands, Mom's Dead Hands, Wizoobs, and Red Ghosts are no longer sped up.

## Custom

* There are no additional changes to the game in this format.
* Custom allows people to race with their own custom rules. For example, you could make a race where you are not allowed to pick up any Devil Room items.
* Make sure that everyone in the race knows the rules before starting.
* This option is used for multi-character speedrun races.

# Racing+ Race Goals

## Blue Baby

* Historically, most races have had the goal of killing Blue Baby, the boss at the end of The Chest.
* There are no additional changes to the game for this goal.

## The Lamb

* The Lamb is the boss at the end of the Dark Room.
* 4 gold chests will now spawn at the beginning of the Dark Room (instead of red chests).
* Teleporting to the Dark Room via a Sacrifice Room on floors 1 through 8 will send you to the next floor instead.

## Mega Satan

* Mega Satan is the boss behind the giant locked door. Players are allowed to take either path to get to Mega Satan.
* The door to Mega Satan will automatically open upon reaching The Chest or the Dark Room.
* Teleporting to the Dark Room via a Sacrifice Room on floors 1 through 8 will send you to the next floor instead.

## Everything

* This goal requires you to kill Isaac, Satan, Blue Baby, The Lamb, and Mega Satan, in order.
* Both The Polaroid and The Negative will spawn after defeating Mom. Neither are required to complete the run.
* After defeating It Lives!, the beam of light will always spawn to take you to The Cathedral.
* After defeating Isaac, a trapdoor will spawn to take you to Sheol.
* After defeating Satan, a beam of light will spawn to take you to The Chest.
* After defeating Blue Baby, a trapdoor will spawn to take you to the Dark Room.
* After defeating The Lamb, backtrack to the starting room and the Mega Satan door will automatically open.
* Defeat Mega Satan to complete the run.
* Teleporting to the Dark Room via a Sacrifice Room on floors 1 through 8 will send you to the next floor instead.

## Custom

* There are no additional changes to the game for this goal.
* Custom allows people to race with their own custom goals. For example, you could make a race where the goal is to beat Mom as fast as possible.
* Make sure that everyone in the race knows the goal before starting.
* This option is used for multi-character speedrun races.
