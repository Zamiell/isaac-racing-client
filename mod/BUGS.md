# Racing+ Mod Known Bugs

Some gameplay-related bugs are not fixable due to the limitations of the Afterbirth+ Lua API.

<br />

## Miscellaneous Bugs

* Various bugs will happen if you alternate between playing two different runs on two different save files.
* When returning to the Boss Rush from a crawlspace, the camera will jerk from the door to the location of the crawlspace.
* Rules cards will sometimes show vanilla seeds instead of tournament winners.
* In a multi-character speedrun, if you save and quit on the frame that the Checkpoint spawns, then you will also spawn a trophy. (Reported by thereisnofuture)
* Voiding a Forget Me Now will crash the game if the mod was loaded for the first or second time. (Reported by Gamonymous)
* Bob's Bladder produces green creep instead of blue. (Reported by PassionDrama)
* If The Forgotten or The Soul falls into a pitfall and dies, then the game will lock up for a few seconds. (Reported by Gamonymous)
* If there are multiple The Haunts in a room, all of the Lil Haunts will be detached at once, because tracking the individual ones is too difficult. (Reported by thereisnofuture)
* Teleports can be canceled if you trigger them on the frame before going into a new room. For example, trying to use Cursed Eye when going in or coming out of a Cursed Room will not work.
* Rarely, the body of the Forgotten will not be teleported to the correct entrance when fighting Gurdy, Mom, Mom's Heart, or It Lives! (Reported by mijibbon)

## Bugs with the Schoolbag

* If put A Pony or a White Pony into the Schoolbag during the charge, you will be put into a state where you are not able to shoot tears. Saving and quitting fixes this.
* If you put Unicorn Stump or My Little Unicorn inside a Schoolbag, it will prematurely end any type of shield. (Found by thisguyisbarry)
* If you are using a Breath of Life and perform a Schoolbag switch before releasing the spacebar, it will continue to drain your new active item.
* If you put Telekinesis into the Schoolbag while the effect is active, your other item will be drained. (Found by TaKer093)
* If you have Breath of Life inside a Schoolbag, it will automatically be dropped by the Butter! trinket if you hold down the "use item" button instead of immediately releasing it. (Found by Thoday)
* If you use Book of Shadows while shooting Shoop Da Whoop, then the shield will be deactivated when the animation from Shoop Da Whoop ends. (Found by Hispa)

## Bugs with Samael

* Picking up a 2nd Sacrificial Dagger will do nothing. Saving and quitting fixes this.
* The Flat Worm trinket causes thrown scythes to glitch out. This is purely a graphical glitch. (Found by TaKer093)
* If you have Ipecac and Death's Touch, the thrown scythe will become invisible. (Reported by Nariom)
* If you have Mom's Knife, you can bypass the throw charge with proper timing to infinitely throw the scythe at close range. (Found by TaKer093)
* You can keep the Scythe shot fully charged without pressing any attack button by charging the scythe and release all attack buttons in a slide transition. Once you press any attack button, the Scythe charge will be released and the bug is fixed. (Found by TaKer093)
* When you have two Wraith Skulls (from using a Diplopia on your initial Wraith Skull), they won't work properly. (Found by Moucheron Quipet)
* Lasers from Jacob's Ladder will only deal 0.1 damage from melee attacks. (Found by Moucheron Quipet)

* It can cause you to get a 2nd Small Rock from a tinted rock. (Reported by Moucheron Quipet)
* It can grant the Stompy transformation if you revive with Magic Mushroom.
* Reviving with Magic Mushroom bugs out the screen. (Reported by thisguyisbarry)
* Being a ghost while Mega Blast is active will show the animation playing but the blast itself will be removed.
* Being a ghost will prevent Brimstone-style lasers from firing. (Reported by Xelnas)
