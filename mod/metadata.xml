A racing mod for The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+[/b][/h1]

[b]1) Live Racing[/b]
Normally a single player game, the Lua mod, client, and server allow players to be able to race against each other in real time.

[b]2) Multi-Character Speedruns[/b]
The Racing+ mod uses custom challenges to facilitate multi-character speedruns, in which you must beat the game multiple times in a row on various characters. You can find the leaderboards here: https://www.speedrun.com/afterbirthplus#Racing%2B

[b]3) The Largest Collection of Bug Fixes That Exist[/b]
The Racing+ mod includes hundreds of bug fixes that remain unpatched in the vanilla game.
