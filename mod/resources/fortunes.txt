go fast

why are you
min-maxing in a
speedrun?

you must be really
desperate for
soul hearts

hoping for a
broken remote?

its only a 1.2%
chance to get a
crystal ball

a curved horn
would be nice
here

i bet you would
like some cancer
right now

the timer is
ticking

tick tock

wasting precious
seconds

this is a message
that is wasting
your time

useless messages
in speedruns sure
are great

racing+ is the
best mod ever
created

you'll never be
as handsome
as zamiel

pro tip: this
is not the way
to get be #1

is doing this
really worth?

use cards and
pills to cancel
animations

always submit
bug reports
via discord

make bomb hearts
to inflame your
opponents

you'll pb one day
