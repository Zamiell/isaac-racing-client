# Racing+ Mod Custom Challenges

* By pressing "Tab" on the challenges portion of the main menu, you can access custom challenges added by mods. The Racing+ mod uses custom challenges to facilitate multi-character speedruns where you must beat the game multiple times in a row on various characters.
* These custom challenges will automatically take you to the next character so that you never have to return to the menu. They will also show a timer on the screen and your current character progress.
* Before starting a speedrun, you must define a character order by using the "Change Char Order" custom challenge.
* You can restart with the current character by tapping R. You can go back to the first character by holding R. (On floors 2 and beyond, you have to double-tap R to restart with the current character.)

### Shared Speedrun Mechanics

* In all seasons other than season 4 and season 6, the first character will get More Options to speed up the process of finding an item and getting a run going (if the character does not already have it). After the Treasure Room is entered, More Options will be removed.
* In all seasons other than season 1 and season 7, both The Polaroid and The Negative will spawn after defeating Mom. Neither are required to travel to The Chest / the Dark Room. This is to increase strategy and decision making.

## Races

* If you want to do a multiplayer race of one of the above seasons, then you can create a race with a format of "Custom" and a race goal of "Custom".
* Note that during the run, the place indicators will not be accurate. This is because the server does not know which character you are on; it only knows about your current floor.
